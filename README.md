## What the user learned
>**I learned Javascript specifically, creating a to-do list, using date and time, local storage, and conditional statements to showcase whether to change into day background, afternoon background, or night background.**

## Things to take note
>**Each project is not tampered with after being completed except for the readme file as this is a way to showcase the development of the user in each project as each project is a new experience for this user. Momentum-app is not responsive as it was the user's first time in using Javascript so the time was mainly used for Javascript integration.**
