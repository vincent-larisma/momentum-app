>**I learned Javascript.**

	
* * * * *



## Things to take note
>**Each project is not tampered with after being completed except for the readme file as this is a way to showcase the development of the user in each project as each project is a new experience for this user. Momentum-app is not responsive as it was the user's first time in using Javascript so the time was mainly used for Javascript integration.**
